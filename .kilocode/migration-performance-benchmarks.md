# Bun Migration Performance Benchmarking Plan

## Objective
Systematically measure and compare performance metrics between the existing npm/mixed setup and the new Bun-based package management approach.

## Benchmark Categories

### 1. Dependency Management
#### Installation Performance
- Total installation time
- Number of packages installed
- Disk space used by `node_modules`
- Network bandwidth consumption

**Measurement Metrics**:
- `time bun install` vs `time npm install`
- Disk usage comparison
- Memory consumption during installation

### 2. Build Process
#### Build Time Comparison
- Project initial build time
- Incremental build performance
- Development server startup time
- Production build optimization

**Measurement Metrics**:
- Total build duration
- Incremental build speed
- Memory usage during build
- CPU utilization

### 3. Runtime Performance
#### Application Performance
- Initial load time
- Time to interactive
- Memory consumption
- CPU profile during typical workflows

**Measurement Tools**:
- Chrome DevTools Performance Tab
- React Profiler
- Node.js built-in profilers
- Custom performance measurement scripts

### 4. Test Execution
#### Test Suite Performance
- Total test run time
- Individual test module performance
- Coverage generation speed
- Parallel test execution capabilities

**Measurement Metrics**:
- `time bun test` vs `time npm test`
- Test coverage generation time
- Memory usage during testing

## Benchmarking Methodology

### Controlled Environment
- Identical hardware configuration
- Clean system state before each test
- Multiple test runs to ensure statistical significance
- Consistent background processes

### Measurement Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Dependency Installation Benchmark
echo "Dependency Installation Benchmark"
time npm install
time bun install

# Build Process Benchmark
echo "Build Process Benchmark"
time npm run build
time bun run build

# Test Execution Benchmark
echo "Test Execution Benchmark"
time npm test
time bun test
```

| Installation Time        | [placeholder] | [placeholder] | [placeholder] |
| Build Time               | [placeholder] | [placeholder] | [placeholder] |
| Test Execution Time      | [placeholder] | [placeholder] | [placeholder] |
| Memory Usage (Install)   | [placeholder] | [placeholder] | [placeholder] |
| Memory Usage (Build)     | [placeholder] | [placeholder] | [placeholder] |

## Detailed Performance Logging

### Logging Configuration
- Capture system metrics
- Log detailed performance data
- Generate comprehensive reports

### Performance Logging Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# System Performance Logging
top -b -n 1 > system_performance.log
ps aux | grep node/bun >> system_performance.log

# Application-specific logging
NODE_OPTIONS="--prof" bun run build
```

## Visualization and Reporting
- Create graphical performance comparisons
- Generate detailed PDF report
- Interactive dashboard for performance metrics

## Success Criteria
- Minimum 20% improvement in installation time
- Reduced memory consumption
- Faster build and test processes
- Consistent or improved application performance

## Potential Optimization Opportunities
- Identify bottlenecks
- Recommend configuration tweaks
- Explore Bun-specific optimizations

## Risk Mitigation
- Prepare rollback strategy if performance degrades
- Incremental performance testing
- Staged rollout approach

## Timeline
- Preparation: 1 day
- Benchmarking: 2-3 days
- Analysis and Reporting: 1-2 days
