  - Parallel testing of npm and Bun builds
  - Detailed performance benchmarking
  - Gradual rollout approach

### 2. Operational Risks
#### Team Adaptation
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Potential Impact**:
  - Learning curve
  - Reduced initial productivity
  - Resistance to change
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Comprehensive team training
  - Detailed migration documentation
  - Pair programming sessions
  - Knowledge sharing workshops

#### Continuous Integration Challenges
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Potential Impact**:
  - CI/CD pipeline failures
  - Inconsistent test results
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Update GitHub Actions workflows
  - Maintain existing test coverage
  - Create fallback mechanisms

### 3. Performance Risks
#### Runtime Performance
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Potential Impact**:
  - Unexpected performance variations
  - Potential memory usage differences
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Comprehensive performance profiling
  - Benchmark comparisons
  - Monitor application metrics

### 4. Compatibility Risks
#### Development Environment
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Potential Impact**:
  - IDE integration issues
  - Plugin compatibility problems
- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Test across different development environments
  - Verify VSCode and other tool integrations

## Risk Scoring Matrix

| Risk Category | Likelihood | Potential Impact | Risk Score | Mitigation Effectiveness |
|--------------|------------|-----------------|------------|--------------------------|
| Dependency   | High       | High            | 9/10       | Medium                  |
| Build Process| Medium     | Medium          | 6/10       | High                    |
| Team Adaptation| Medium   | Medium          | 6/10       | Medium                  |
| CI/CD        | Medium     | High            | 7/10       | High                    |
| Performance  | Low        | Medium          | 3/10       | High                    |

## Rollback Strategy
- Maintain npm configuration files
- Preserve original `package-lock.json`
- Create detailed rollback procedure
- Establish clear rollback triggers

## Monitoring and Evaluation Plan
- Track migration progress
- Collect team feedback
- Monitor performance metrics
- Conduct post-migration review

## Recommended Actions
1. Create migration branch
2. Perform dependency audit
3. Update build configurations
4. Develop comprehensive test suite
5. Plan team training
6. Implement gradual rollout

## Contingency Planning
- Identify critical failure points
- Prepare emergency rollback procedure
- Establish communication channels
- Define escalation process

## Conclusion
While the migration presents challenges, the potential benefits of improved performance and developer experience outweigh the risks when proper mitigation strategies are implemented.

## Approval and Next Steps
- Review with technical leadership
- Obtain team consensus
- Schedule migration kickoff
