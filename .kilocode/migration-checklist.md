# Bun Migration Checklist

## Pre-Migration Preparation
- [ ] Backup entire project repository
- [ ] Ensure Bun is installed (version 1.0+)
- [ ] Review all project dependencies
- [ ] Inform team about upcoming migration

## Dependency Management
### Dependency Audit
- [ ] Check for npm-specific package scripts
- [ ] Verify peer dependency compatibility
- [ ] Identify potential Bun-specific issues

### Lockfile and Package Management
- [ ] Remove `package-lock.json`
- [ ] Delete `node_modules` directory
- [ ] Run `bun install` to generate `bun.lockb`

## Build and Development Workflow
### Script Updates
- [ ] Replace npm scripts with Bun equivalents in `package.json`
- [ ] Verify development server starts correctly
- [ ] Check build process functionality

### Testing
- [ ] Run `bun test` 
- [ ] Verify test coverage generation
- [ ] Check Vitest configuration compatibility

## Continuous Integration
### GitHub Actions
- [ ] Update workflows to use Bun consistently
- [ ] Verify test and build pipelines work
- [ ] Check artifact and cache handling

## Docker Configuration
### Dockerfile Modifications
- [ ] Update base image to Bun-compatible
- [ ] Replace npm commands with Bun commands
- [ ] Verify Docker build process
- [ ] Test container startup and functionality

## Performance and Compatibility
### Validation Checks
- [ ] Compare dependency installation time
- [ ] Check `node_modules` size
- [ ] Verify no runtime differences

## Potential Rollback Preparation
- [ ] Keep npm configuration files as backup
- [ ] Document any discovered incompatibilities
- [ ] Prepare rollback strategy documentation

## Post-Migration Tasks
- [ ] Update project documentation
- [ ] Communicate changes to team
- [ ] Schedule team knowledge sharing session
- [ ] Monitor project performance

## Critical Success Indicators
- [ ] ✅ Dependencies install correctly
- [ ] ✅ Development server runs
- [ ] ✅ All tests pass
- [ ] ✅ Production build succeeds
- [ ] ✅ Docker image builds and runs

## Estimated Effort Levels
- Low Risk Tasks: 2-4 hours
- Medium Risk Tasks: 1-2 days
- High Risk Investigation: Potential week-long process

## Recommended Implementation Approach
1. Create dedicated migration branch
2. Perform incremental migration
3. Validate each stage thoroughly
4. Get team consensus before merging
