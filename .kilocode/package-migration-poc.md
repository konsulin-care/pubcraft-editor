# Package Management Migration Proof-of-Concept

## Objectives
- Validate Bun-based build and test process
- Ensure compatibility with existing project setup
- Verify Docker build functionality

## Test Checklist

### 1. Local Development Environment
- [ ] Install Bun
- [ ] Remove `node_modules`
- [ ] Install dependencies using `bun install`
- [ ] Run development server
- [ ] Run tests
- [ ] Build project

### 2. Docker Build Verification
- [ ] Build Docker image using new Dockerfile
- [ ] Run Docker container locally
- [ ] Verify application starts correctly

### 3. CI/CD Compatibility
- [ ] Verify GitHub Actions workflows
- [ ] Check test coverage generation
- [ ] Validate Docker image build process

## Potential Risks and Mitigations
- Dependency compatibility
- Build tool variations
- Performance differences

## Rollback Strategy
- Keep original Dockerfile and package-lock.json
- Ability to revert to npm if critical issues arise
