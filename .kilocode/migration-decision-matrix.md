## Decision Recommendation Framework

### Decision Tree
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Migration Decision] --> B{Technical Compatibility}
    B --> |High Compatibility| C{Performance Potential}
    B --> |Partial Compatibility| D[Incremental Migration]
    B --> |Low Compatibility| E[Defer Migration]
    
    C --> |Significant Improvement| F[Proceed with Migration]
    C --> |Marginal Improvement| G[Conduct Further Analysis]
```

### Recommendation Levels
1. **Immediate Migration**
   - Excellent compatibility
   - Significant performance gains
   - Low migration risk

2. **Incremental Migration**
   - Partial compatibility
   - Moderate performance improvements
   - Managed risk approach

3. **Defer Migration**
   - Significant compatibility challenges
   - Minimal performance benefits
   - High migration risk

## Implementation Approach

### Phased Migration Strategy
1. Dependency Audit
2. Pilot Project Migration
3. Comprehensive Testing
4. Team Training
5. Full Rollout
6. Continuous Monitoring
