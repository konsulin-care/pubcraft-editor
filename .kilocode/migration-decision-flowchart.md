## Decision Points Explained

### 1. Preliminary Compatibility Check
- Assess overall project dependency compatibility
- Identify potential integration challenges
- Determine initial feasibility

### 2. Dependency Audit
- Comprehensive review of project dependencies
- Identify npm-specific or problematic packages
- Develop compatibility resolution strategy

### 3. Risk Assessment
- Evaluate technical and organizational risks
- Analyze potential performance impacts
- Develop risk mitigation strategies

### 4. Incremental Migration
- Implement staged migration approach
- Start with non-critical projects or components
- Validate each migration stage

### 5. Pilot Migration
- Select representative project or component
- Perform full migration in controlled environment
- Validate functionality and performance

### 6. Performance Benchmarking
- Conduct comprehensive performance testing
- Compare metrics with existing setup
- Identify potential optimization opportunities

### 7. Final Approval
- Review all migration data
- Obtain stakeholder consensus
- Make final migration decision
