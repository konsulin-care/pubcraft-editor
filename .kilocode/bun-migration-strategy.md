# Bun Migration Strategy for Pubcraft Editor

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive strategy for migrating the project's package management from npm to Bun.

## Motivation
- Improved performance
- Faster dependency installation
- Native TypeScript and JSX support
- Simplified package management

## Migration Phases

### 1. Preparation
- [ ] Verify Bun installation (version 1.0+)
- [ ] Backup existing `package-lock.json`
- [ ] Review all project dependencies for Bun compatibility

### 2. Dependency Conversion
- Replace `npm` commands with `bun` equivalents
- Update `package.json` scripts
- Remove `package-lock.json`
- Generate `bun.lockb`

### 3. Development Environment
- Update local development workflows
- Modify CI/CD pipelines
- Adjust Docker configuration

## Potential Compatibility Challenges

### Dependency Variations
Some packages might have slight behavioral differences:
- Check for any npm-specific package scripts
- Verify peer dependency resolution
- Test critical path dependencies thoroughly

### Build Tool Differences
- Vite compatibility
- TypeScript compilation
- Test runner (Vitest) configuration

## Risk Mitigation

### Rollback Strategy
1. Keep npm `package-lock.json` as backup
2. Maintain ability to switch back to npm
3. Document any discovered incompatibilities

### Compatibility Checklist
- [ ] Development server starts correctly
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Production build succeeds
- [ ] Docker build works as expected

## Performance Expectations
- Faster dependency installation
- Reduced `node_modules` size
- Potential cold start performance improvements

## Team Communication
- Notify all team members about the migration
- Provide migration guide
- Schedule knowledge sharing session

## Monitoring and Validation
- Track any performance improvements
- Document discovered issues
- Create feedback mechanism for team

## Post-Migration Tasks
- Update project documentation
- Revise contribution guidelines
- Remove npm-specific configuration files

## Estimated Migration Effort
- Low Risk: 2-4 hours
- Medium Risk: 1-2 days
- High Risk: Potential week-long investigation if major incompatibilities found

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Create migration branch
2. Perform incremental migration
3. Validate each stage thoroughly
4. Get team consensus before merging
