## Detailed Evaluation Methodology

### 1. Dependency Management Analysis

#### Compatibility Matrix
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Dependency Compatibility] --> B[Core Dependencies]
    A --> C[UI Libraries]
    A --> D[Build Tools]
    A --> E[Testing Frameworks]
```

#### Dependency Installation Benchmark
```bash
# Comparative Installation Metrics
time npm install
time bun install
```

##### Metrics Tracked
- Total installation time
- Number of packages
- Network bandwidth usage
- Disk space consumption

### 2. Build Process Validation

#### Build Configuration
```typescript
// vite.config.ts PoC Configuration
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    // Bun-specific optimizations
    bunOptimizationPlugin()
  ],
  build: {
    // Performance tracking
    reportCompressedSize: true
  }
});
```

#### Performance Measurements
- Build initialization time
- Compilation speed
- Bundle size
- Tree-shaking effectiveness

### 3. Runtime Performance Profiling

#### Benchmark Scenarios
1. Initial application load
2. Complex markdown rendering
3. Bibliography management
4. GitHub synchronization workflow

#### Performance Metrics
- Memory consumption
- CPU utilization
- Execution time
- Garbage collection behavior

### 4. Development Workflow Integration

#### Developer Experience Evaluation
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
- Error reporting
- TypeScript integration
- Debugging capabilities

### 5. Testing Ecosystem

#### Test Runner Comparison
```bash
# Comparative Test Execution
npm test
bun test
```

##### Test Coverage Metrics
- Total test execution time
- Memory usage during testing
- Code coverage generation
- Parallel test execution
