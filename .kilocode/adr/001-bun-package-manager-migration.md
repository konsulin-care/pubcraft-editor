# ADR 001: Migration to Bun Package Manager

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The Pubcraft Editor currently uses a mixed package management approach with npm and Bun, leading to potential inconsistencies in dependency management, build processes, and development workflows.

## Decision Drivers
- Performance optimization
- Simplified dependency management
- Consistent development experience
- Improved build and test processes

## Considered Alternatives
1. Maintain current mixed approach
2. Revert to full npm usage
3. Migrate completely to Bun
4. Explore alternative package managers (Yarn, pnpm)

## Chosen Solution: Migrate to Bun

### Rationale
- Significantly faster package installation
- Native TypeScript and JSX support
- Reduced `node_modules` size
- Built-in test runner and bundler
- Growing ecosystem and community support

## Architectural Impact

### Dependency Management
- Replace `package-lock.json` with `bun.lockb`
- Ensure consistent dependency resolution
- Validate package compatibility

### Build Process
- Update build scripts to use Bun commands
- Maintain existing Vite and Vitest configurations
- Ensure seamless integration with existing toolchain

### Continuous Integration
- Modify GitHub Actions to use Bun exclusively
- Maintain existing test and build pipelines
- Ensure consistent behavior across different environments

## Potential Risks
- Dependency incompatibilities
- Performance variations
- Learning curve for team members

## Mitigation Strategies
- Comprehensive testing
- Incremental migration approach
- Maintain rollback capability
- Team training and knowledge sharing

## Implementation Phases
1. Dependency audit
2. Script and configuration updates
3. Testing and validation
4. Team review and approval
5. Gradual rollout

## Expected Outcomes
- Faster development workflows
- Reduced dependency management complexity
- Improved project performance
- Enhanced developer experience

## Monitoring and Evaluation
- Track dependency installation times
- Monitor build and test performance
- Gather team feedback
- Assess long-term project impact

## Decision Consequences
### Positive
- Performance improvements
- Simplified package management
- Modern tooling adoption

### Negative
- Potential short-term disruption
- Learning curve
- Possible compatibility challenges
