# Package Management Migration Plan

## Current State Analysis
- **Existing Package Manager**: Mixed (npm and Bun)
- **Lockfiles**: `package-lock.json` and `bun.lockb`
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions configured for Bun
- **Docker Build**: Currently using npm

## Migration Objectives
1. Unify package management with Bun
2. Ensure seamless development and build processes
3. Maintain existing project functionality
4. Improve development workflow efficiency

## Detailed Migration Strategy

### 1. Dependency Management
- Remove `package-lock.json`
- Use `bun install` for dependency management
- Verify all dependencies are compatible with Bun

### 2. Build and Test Workflow
- Update all npm scripts to use Bun commands
- Ensure Vite, Vitest, and other build tools work correctly
- Maintain existing test coverage and build processes

### 3. Docker Configuration
- Modify Dockerfile to use Bun-based image
- Replace npm commands with Bun equivalents
- Ensure production build remains consistent

### 4. Continuous Integration
- Update GitHub Actions to use Bun consistently
- Maintain existing test and build pipelines

## Potential Challenges
- Dependency resolution differences
- Potential package script incompatibilities
- Performance variations

## Mitigation Strategies
- Incremental migration
- Comprehensive testing
- Rollback plan maintained

## Recommended Implementation Steps
1. Create migration branch
2. Remove `package-lock.json`
3. Update `package.json` scripts
4. Modify Dockerfile
5. Update GitHub Actions workflows
6. Thorough testing
7. Team review and approval

## Success Criteria
- ✅ All dependencies install correctly
- ✅ Development server runs
- ✅ Tests pass
- ✅ Production build succeeds
- ✅ Docker image builds and runs

## Rollback Procedure
- Revert to previous Dockerfile
- Restore `package-lock.json`
- Reinstall npm dependencies

## Timeline
- Estimated Migration Time: 4-8 hours
- Recommended Testing Period: 1-2 days

## Post-Migration Tasks
- Update project documentation
- Communicate changes to team
- Monitor performance and stability
